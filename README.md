# Cucumber-Java-GAP-Silvio Yopasa

##Description
This project was develop as part of the hiring process

## Usage
Open a command window and run:

    mvn test

This runs Cucumber features using Cucumber's JUnit runner. The `@RunWith(Cucumber.class)` annotation on the `RunCukesTest`
class tells JUnit to kick off Cucumber.

## Overriding options

The Cucumber runtime parses command line options to know what features to run, where the glue code lives, what plugins to use etc.
When you use the JUnit runner, these options are generated from the `@CucumberOptions` annotation on your test.

Sometimes it can be useful to override these options without changing or recompiling the JUnit class. This can be done with the
`cucumber.options` system property. The general form is:

    mvn -Dcucumber.options="..." test
